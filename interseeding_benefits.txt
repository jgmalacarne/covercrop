<p class="body-font">Interseeding cover crops between cash crops has many benefits when seeded at the appropriate time.</p>
<p class="header-font"><b>Benefits include:</b><br>
<ul class="body-font">
<li>Significantly reduced erosion both in season, and immediately during and after harvest.</li>
<li>Ease of access to the field during wet periods (cleaner boots and crops).</li>
<li>Reduced soil splashing on crops.</li>
<li>Reduced nutrient leaching and loss overwinter.</li>
<li>Reduced post harvest land management and labor requirements. The cover crop is seeded in late-July to mid-August. This means that the crop just needs to be mowed post harvest to knock back crop residue and any weeds that may have emerged past the cover crop. No additional seeding or land preparation is needed during this busy and often muddy time of the year.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="header-font"><b>Drawbacks include:</b><br>
<ul class="body-font">
<li>The cost of the seed and labor needed to seed in late-July to mid-August. This can be mitigated by incorporating the seeding process into the final cultivation pass, and/or sidedressing the crop.</li>
<li>If an interseeded cover crop is seeded during a dry spell with no irrigation available, there is the risk of a failed seeding.</li>
<li>If seeding too early in the season, the cover crop could compete with the cash crop for nutrients, water, or airflow. Although our research team has seen little evidence of this, farmers should be aware of these risks.</li>
</ul>
